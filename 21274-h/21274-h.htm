HE following little illustrated effusion is offered to the public, in
the hope that it may not prove altogether uninteresting, or entirely
inappropriate to the times. The famous pre-historic story of Ulysses
and Polyphemus has received its counterpart in the case of two
well-known personages of our own age and country. Ulysses of old
contrived, with a burning stake, to put out the glaring eye of
Polyphemus, the man-eating Cyclops, and thereby to abridge his power
for cannibal indulgence; while our modern Ulysses, perhaps, mindful of
his classical prototype, is content to leave the new Polyphemus safely
"bottled-up" under the hermetical seal of the saucy Rebel Beauregard.
Although the second Cyclops is yet
<span class="left"><a name="Page_four" id="Page_four">[Pg&nbsp;4]</a></span>
alive, and still possesses the visual organ in a squinting degree, a regard
 for impartial history compels us to add, that the sword which leapt
from its scabbard in front of Fort Fisher, has fallen from the grasp of
the "bottled" chieftain, whether from an invincible repugnance to
warlike deeds, like that which pervaded the valiant soul of the renowned
Falstaff, or because an axe on the public grindstone is a more congenial
weapon in the itching palm of a Knight of Spoons, has not yet been
determined with absolute precision.</p>

<p>The warrior Ulysses, like his namesake of Ithaca, however widely
opinion may militate upon his other qualifications, certainly deserves
the everlasting gratitude of a spoon-desolated country for the
strategy displayed in tearing off the plumes of the American
Polyphemus, and fixing that precious flower of knighthood among the
"bottled" curiosities of natural history.</p>

<p>Progressive age! for contemplation's eye,<br />
Thy checker'd scenes a glorious field supply;<br />
Time was when Mercury waved the potent wand,<br />
And Nature brightened in the artist's hand,&mdash;<br />
When mind's dominion round the world was thrown,<br />
Before usurping Mammon seized the throne.<br />
Aspiring genius, chill thy noble rage,<br />
For baser uses rule our iron age;<br />
Drive the hard bargain, mart for sordid gain,<br />
And where it will not win, hold honor vain;</p>

<p>To lofty subjects bring the narrow view,<br />
Shift with each scene, and principle eschew.<br />
Are these the elements of man's success?<br />
Go where the busy throng all onward press;<br />
Ay, there they flourish and will long remain,<br />
Till virtue purge the haunts where vice doth reign.<br />
Not to the few the moral taint's confined,<br />
But in its boundless range infects mankind;<br />
'Twere idle to upbraid the good old plea&mdash;<br />
Might governs all, the rest were mock'ry.<br />
The plumpest fly a sparrow's meal provides&mdash;<br />
The heartless bird its agony derides:<br />
"Nay," quoth relentless Sparrow, "you must die,<br />
For you, weak thing, are not so strong as I."<br />
A Hawk surprised him at his dainty meal,<br />
In vain the Sparrow gasped his last appeal;</p>

Grimly an Eagle viewed the state of matters,<br />
Swoops on Sir Hawk, and tears his flesh to tatters:<br />
"Release me, King, and doom me not to die;"<br />
The Eagle said, "thou art less strong than I."<br />
A bullet whistled at the victor's word,<br />
And pierced the bosom of the lordly bird;<br />
"Ah, tyrant!" shrieked he, "wherefore must I die?"<br />
The Sportsman said, "thou art less strong than I."<br />

Where stern oppression held her impious reign,<br />

Tartarean pits, where fiends with darkness gloom'd;<br />
But 'mid th' infernal host this face had shone,<br />
Grimmest of all 'neath dread Armageddon.<br />
The outward form proclaimed the inner man,<br />
And frightened virtue fled where it began;<br />
The heart, the head, there devils might fear to dwell,<br />
Lest in their depths there lurked a deeper hell,<br />
Does fiction, fancy, gild the picture drawn,<br />

<p>Oh! hapless hour, when from the stormy North,<br />
This modern Cyclops marched repellent forth,<br />
To slake his thirst for blood and plundered wealth,<br />
Not as the soldier, but by fraud and stealth;<br />
To waft the gales of death with horror rife<br />
On helpless age, and wage with women strife:<br />
To leave at Baltimore and New Orleans<br />
The drunkard's name, or worse, the gibbet's scenes;<br />
To license lust with all a lecher's rage,<br />
And stab the virtue of a Christian age:</p>

And millions join the Jubilee of Peace!</p>
